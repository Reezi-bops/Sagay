                    <h3>Cabin Reef</h3>
                    <p>The Carbin Reef is a spotless white sandbar that sits off the shore of Sagay town in the Negros Occidental province. It is also part of the Sagay Marine Reserve, a 32,000-hectare protected seascape.
                        Aside from its beautiful white sand, the reef's surrounding waters are teeming with wildlife so make sure to bring some snorkeling gear during your visit here. Underneath the waves, you will find a vibrant aquatic ecosystem filled with colorful schools of fish and other marine animals.
                        Since the area is well protected, you may also get to spot a sea turtle gliding through the water if you're lucky!

                    <h3>Sagay</h3>
                    <p>The local community did not treasure its beautiful mangrove forest and its wildlife, which is why the destination decided to introduce ecotourism. Through social media marketing campaigns the community first realised how important the environment is, that they should be proud of their island and how important it is to protect these assets. This made the awareness in biodiversity increase drastically. The local community then also got directly included in the scientific counting if the species in the mangrove forest and was able to report on a high increase in flying foxes in the area this year.
                        The beauty of the destination further got displayed in an international movie being filmed there and the accomplishments of the good practice acknowledged through several recognitions.

                    <p>This week was the celebration of the feast and Marcelina brings with her a bag filled with a rosary, personal belongings, and around five to six novena booklets for different saints, including St.
                        Vincent. While the devotees filled the votive stands with colored candles, you can hear Marcelina and the other elders chanting prayers for the Pabasa rites.
                        "Pabasa has been my way to show my devotion to Señor San Vicente," Marcelina said, adding "For almost 20 years, I have been consistently praying for good health not just of mine and my husband but of those people who ask me to do the Pabasa for them.
